Choosing to read a complete story takes you to a story instance that has
been saved for others to see. Upon viewing the story, you have the option
to rate it based on specific criteria.

2 / 5 - Completing an incomplete story

%P%

If you choose to complete an existing, incomplete story, you'll be presented
with a set of prompts that you are to fill. They also contain grammatical
context clues for each prompt, so that you can fill in the blanks correctly.
If you leave some of the prompts empty, default words will be used in such
places.

Once you fill in all of the prompts, you can submit it. You'll then be
presented with a complete story that contains your inputs. You can then
choose whether you'd like to make it public. Additionally, you can rate
the incomplete story on its quality, usability etc.

Here you'll be presented with a text box, in which you are to write the story.
You are instructed to write a complete story that contains the default words.
There are separate text fields where you can write the context clues (for
example, how exactly should the words be typed). If no context clue is given,
for a prompt, then the default word is used as the context clue.
