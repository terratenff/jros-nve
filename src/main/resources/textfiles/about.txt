The Storytellers Anonymous is a website in which users can make stories
for other users to complete and share them with other readers to read.

The stories can be created, completed and read anonymously. The stories can
also be rated based on different criteria, which are taken into account
whenever readers look into highlighted stories.

This service is based on the well-known social game; the writer of the group
creates a story with blanks, while other people in the group fill the blanks
without knowing the full story. Once all of the blanks have been filled,
the writer tells the story. Often times hilarity would ensue.

The Storytellers Anonymous allows you to take part in such a social game by
yourself, without the need of a group. You can contribute to the service
by creating new stories for others to complete, or by filling blanks on
incomplete stories, so that others can read the complete story.
